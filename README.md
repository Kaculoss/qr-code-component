## My process

### Built with

- Typescript
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library
- [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) - React framework
- [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) - For the Style

### Continued development

I am still trying to understand Nextjs 13 in details
I am also new to Typescript

### Useful resources

- [Nextjs 13 Beta Static Icon](https://beta.nextjs.org/docs/api-reference/metadata#static-icon) - This helped me to figure out how to insert my personal Icon into the project

## Deploy on Vercel

The easiest way to deploy your Next.js app is to use the [Vercel Platform](https://vercel.com/new?utm_medium=default-template&filter=next.js&utm_source=create-next-app&utm_campaign=create-next-app-readme) from the creators of Next.js.

Check out our [Next.js deployment documentation](https://nextjs.org/docs/deployment) for more details.
